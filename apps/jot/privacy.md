**Just One Thing (JOT)**

**Effective Date:** January 2, 2026

## Overview

Just One Thing (“JOT”) is a macOS menubar application designed to help users focus on a single task, intention, or area of focus. JOT is built with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

JOT does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal data.

Specifically:

- No user accounts are required
- No analytics or tracking tools are used
- No data is sent to external servers
- No personal or device information is collected

All data entered into JOT (such as task or focus text) is stored locally on your device using standard macOS storage mechanisms.

## Data Usage

Because JOT does not collect any personal data, no data is:

- Analyzed
- Sold
- Shared with third parties
- Used for advertising or profiling

## Network Access

JOT does not require an internet connection to function and does not make network requests related to user data.

## Third-Party Services

JOT does not integrate with third-party services, SDKs, or analytics providers.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, data security is handled by macOS system protections. JOT does not have access to data outside of its own local storage.

## Children’s Privacy

JOT does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If JOT’s functionality changes in a way that affects privacy, this policy will be updated accordingly. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
